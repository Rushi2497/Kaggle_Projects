# Kaggle Projects

This is a repository of machine learning projects that I did from competitions/datasets available on Kaggle.\
Kaggle is an online community platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. Kaggle allows users to collaborate with other users, find and publish datasets. They also host competitions for ML enthusiasts to try out and bring their best data preprocessing and ML practices to the table.
